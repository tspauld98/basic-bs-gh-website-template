# BRC Static Bootstrap Website Project Template for Github Pages

This is a basic template for a static website project using Grunt as the build tool and Github Pages for hosting.  This template is the basis for several other BRC front-end project templates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your machine:

* (Optional, but HIGHLY Recommended) [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - This will allow you to easily install and switch between different versions of Node.js and npm.  You can find OS-specific installation instructions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - This is the runtime environment for Grunt on the local development workstation that will be used to build your project.  The best way to install Node.js is to use nvm [see these usage instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage).  If you are not using nvm, you can find OS-specific installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). `npm` should be installed along with Node.js automatically.  If it is not, you can find instructions for installing `npm` [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
* [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) - This is the build tool that will be used to build your project.  You can install Grunt by running the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
    npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local development workstation.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
    npm install
```
